# Assistify
Assistify aims to seamlessly integrate IoT devices and adaptive controls under one user-friendly Android application. With real-time monitoring capabilities, we empower caregivers to watch over vulnerable care-recipients, alerting them to any potential hazards. This app is designed to offer peace of mind to both caregivers and care-recipients, enhancing independence while ensuring safety.
